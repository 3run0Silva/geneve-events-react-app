# Geneva Events  (GEE)
Welcome to Geneva Events Agenda, your one-stop solution for finding and managing events in Geneva. This application aims to simplify the task of discovering events happening in the area with a user-friendly and clean UI.

## Features

Category View: Click on a category to view all related events.
Event Details: Click on an event to view detailed information including title, date, and description.
User Authentication: Create an account, log in, and access personalized features.
Profile Management: Logged-in users can change their username and avatar from the profile page.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
A backend server running the Python API to fetch event data.

### Installing
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/3run0Silva/geneve-events-react-app
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd yourrepo
```
Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
The application should now be running on localhost
